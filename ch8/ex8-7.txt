Exercise 8-7.  malloc() accepts a size request without checking its
plausibility; free() believes that the block it is asked to free contains a
valid size field. Improve these routines so they take more pains with
error checking.


Solution 8-7.
According to the malloc() and free() man pages, when malloc() gets a bad
size it returns NULL. When free() gets a bad block, it does nothing.
