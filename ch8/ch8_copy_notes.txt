The following command does not work. Why?

$ ./ch8_copy <(cat test7.txt test8.txt testdir/test1.txt testdir/test2.txt) > ch8_copy_test_output.txt

Command doesn't return to shell. Output file is empty. All file exist.

$ cat test7.txt test8.txt testdir/test1.txt testdir/test2.txt

produces the correct output.

$ ./ch8_copy < test7.txt > ch8_copy_test_output.txt

also works.
