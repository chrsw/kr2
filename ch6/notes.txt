The text version of getword() seems to have an issue with newlines (\n) being
counted as words sometimes. Not sure why.
Punctuation characters, like '?' are also treated as separate words.

getword() does not properly handle underscores (see getword_test3_output.txt).
Notice in this output how one underscore is dangling outside of a word.
For exercise 6-1, the function should be modifed to accept the underscore
character '_' as another alphanumeric character as it's building its word
string. Leading underscores will not be treated as a word.
