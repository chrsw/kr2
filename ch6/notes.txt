The text version of getword() seems to have an issue with newlines (\n) being
counted as words sometimes. Not sure why.
Punctuation characters, like '?' are also treated as separate words.

getword() does not properly handle underscores (see getword_test3_output.txt).
Notice in this output how one underscore is dangling outside of a word.
For exercise 6-1, the function should be modified to accept the underscore
character '_' as another alphanumeric character as it's building its word
string. Leading underscores will not be treated as a word.

What does it mean to properly handle string constants?
"this is a string constant". Are words inside string constants not counted
as words??
From looking at getword_test4_output.txt you can see that the getword()
function treats every quotation character as a separate word. This breaks
string literals. "every word" should return two words: 'every' and 'word',
not four words '"', 'every', 'word' and '"' again.
One way to fix this is to ignore "'s.
