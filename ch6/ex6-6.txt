Exercise 6-6. Implement a simple version of the #define processor (i.e., no arguments) suitable for
use with C programs, based on the routines of this section. You may also find getch() and ungetch()
helpful.


Goal:
Read standard input, find lines that begin with
#define
Add an entry to the global lookup table that includes the #define'd string.
e.g.
#define IN 1
Then in the global lookup table "IN" is a new name and the definition is "1" (string, not number).

Routines provided
install()
lookup() (public?)

Routines needed
TBD

Files:
table.c
getch.c
getword.c
