# About this repo
Code for _The C Programming Language 2nd Ed._ (K&R2) Kernighan & Ritchie, 1988, Prentice Hall

Build instructions are embedded in source files or sub-directories.

This repo contains exercises, original solutions, code snippets, examples, thoughts, etc. related to K&R2. The excerpts from the book are mostly left as-is. The solutions, helpers and derived code are mostly written in a more modern style (C99) than is found in the book.

Most code uses Standard C, Standard C Library (default GCC and GNU Lib C on Ubuntu 20.04), with no other dependencies. Some code might use GNU C extensions and should be noted.

This code isn't designed to be completely correct in all cases, only meant to fulfill the spirit of the exercise. With few exceptions, safety and portability are not a consideration. That is, these code snippets are mainly for pedagogical purposes, not for production or expert reference.

The plan is to eventually add more helpful comments and test code.
