Code for The C Programming Language 2nd Ed. Kernighan & Ritchie, 1988, Prentice Hall

This repo contains exercises, solutions, code snippets, examples, thoughts, etc. related to K&R2. Solutions are written in a more modern style than is typically found in the book.

All code uses Standard C, Standard C Library (default GCC standard and GNU Lib C on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04), with no external dependencies.

The plan is to eventually add more helpful comments and test code.
