# About this repo
Code for _The C Programming Language 2nd Ed._ (K&R2) Kernighan & Ritchie, 1988, Prentice Hall

This repo contains exercises, solutions, code snippets, examples, thoughts, etc. related to K&R2. The code in this repo is written in a more modern style (C99) than is typically found in the book.

All code uses Standard C, Standard C Library (default GCC and GNU Lib C on Ubuntu 20.04), with no other dependencies.

This code isn't designed to be completely correct in all cases, only meant to fulfill the spirit of the exercise. With few exceptions, safety and portability are not a consideration. That is, these code snippets are mainly for pedagogical purposes, not production or reference for experts.

The plan is to eventually add more helpful comments and test code.
