# About this repo
Code for _The C Programming Language 2nd Ed._ (K&R2) Kernighan & Ritchie, 1988, Prentice Hall

This repo contains exercises, original solutions, code snippets, examples, thoughts, etc. related to K&R2. The excerpts from the book are mostly left as -is. The solutions, helpers and derived code are mostly written in a more modern style (C99) than is found in the book.

All code uses Standard C, Standard C Library (default GCC and GNU Lib C on Ubuntu 20.04), with no other dependencies.

This code isn't designed to be completely correct in all cases, only meant to fulfill the exercise. With few exceptions, safety and portability are not a consideration. That is, these code snippets are mainly for pedagogical purposes, not production or reference for experts.

The plan is to eventually add more helpful comments and test code.
