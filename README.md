# About this repo
Code for _The C Programming Language 2nd Ed._ (K&R2) Kernighan & Ritchie, 1988, Prentice Hall

This repo contains exercises, solutions, code snippets, examples, thoughts, etc. related to K&R2. The code in this repro is written in a more modern style than is typically found in the book.

All code uses Standard C, Standard C Library (default GCC and GNU Lib C on Ubuntu 20.04), with no other dependencies.

The plan is to eventually add more helpful comments and test code.

### Contents
1. ch1-8 code, mostly solutions per chanpter.
2. template.[ch] convenient starting point for source files.
