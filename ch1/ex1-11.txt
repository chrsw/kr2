Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of
input are most likely to to uncover bugs if there are any?

hyphenated word near the end of a line
this is a very long line of text that will end in the middle of a kind of long-
ish word. the wc program will count this as two words becaue it doesn't take
the hyphen into account.

a multi-gigabyte file will probably break this little program too.

a program with non-printable bytes could throw off the IN/OUT state machine.
