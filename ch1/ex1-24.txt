Exercise 1-24.  Write a program to check a C program for rudimenatary syntax
errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences and comments.

Solution 1-24.
Some hints:
Keep it simple, this is still chapter 1 of the book, the entire language
hasn't been introduced yet.
Parentheses, brackets, curly braces have to be balanced.
Comments have to be accounted for, only block comments: /* */. Don't track
anything inside comments except the block comment markers as well,
those have to match.
Can test on existing C sources in this project and some modified
bad files.

Quotes have to be balanced as well.

Start with the comment stripping program of Exercise 1-23 and adapt it to this
problem.

Started with ex1-23.c and added code to check for balanced symbols and
operators.
