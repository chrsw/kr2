Exercise 1-24.

Write a general, basic C program checker.

Some hints:
Keep it simple, this is still chapter 1 of the book, the entire language
hasn't been introduced yet.
Parentheses, brackets, curly braces have to be balanced.
Comments have to be accounted for, only block comments: /* */. Don't track
anything inside comments except the block comment markers as well,
those have to match.
Can test on existing C sources in this project and some modified
bad files.
