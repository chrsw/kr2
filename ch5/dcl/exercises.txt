Section 5.12 Complicated Declarations

Since the programs are intended to be illustrative, not bullet-proof, there
are significant restrictions on `dcl`. It can only handle a simple data type
like `char` or `int`. It doe snot handle argument types in functions or
qualifiers like `const`. Spurious blanks confuse it. It doesn't do much error
recovery, so invalid declarations will also confuse it. These improvements are
left as exercises to the reader.

Exercise 5-18.  Make dcl recover from input errors.

Exercise 5-19.  Modify undcl so that it does not add redundant parentheses to declarations.

Exercise 5-20.  Expand dcl to handle declarations with function argument types, qualifiers like const and so on.
