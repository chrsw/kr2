Problem:
Modify the pattern matching program of Chapter 5 to take its input from a set
of named files or, if no files are named as arguments, from standard input.
Should the file name be printed when a matching line is found?

Chapter 5 pattern matching program is called 'find' and its listing is in section 5.10 on page 117.

Design notes/thoughts:
Typical command with no command line options (switches):
$ ./ex7-find ex7_test.txt ex7_test2.txt pattern

Example with command line arguments:
$ ./ex7-find -x -n ex7_test.txt ex7_test2.txt pattern

argv[0] = "./ex7_find"
argv[1] = "-x"
argv[2] = "-n"
argv[3] = "ex7_test.txt"
argv[4] = "ex7_test2.txt"
argv[5] = "pattern"

argc = 6

argv starts at argv[0]
argv++ goes to argv[1]

Commond options or switches have to start with "-"

Skip argv[0]
Loop through the argument list for every argument item that starts with "-"
Use the rest of the argumets as normal, assuming the rest of the arguments
are all either file names to use or patterns to use.
The last argument is the pattern.

For solution, see ex7_find.c

Running examples:
$ ./ex7-find ex7_test2.txt missing.txt ex7_test.txt pattern
ex7_find: can't open missing.txt
